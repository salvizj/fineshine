				"Auto detailing (from English – 'automotive detailed processing') is a meticulous process of cleaning, restoring, and protecting a vehicle’s exterior and interior. It includes deep cleaning, correction of necessary elements, and the application of special products to preserve the achieved result. Every centimeter and detail is refined, making the car appear as close to new as possible – regardless of its previous condition or year of manufacture.",
			description_2:
				"Auto detailing is divided into two main categories – exterior (exterior finish) and interior (interior finish) care.
